      "Answer from Plotly CEO & Co-Founder Jack Parmer:\n",
      "\n",
      "> Plotly is like graphing crack. It standardizes the graphing interface across scientific computing languages (Python, R, MATLAB, etc) while giving rich interactivity and web shareability that has not been possible before with matplotlib, ggplot, MATLAB, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "> On the Plotly website, you can style your graphs with a GUI, so you don't have to spend hours writing code that simply changes the legend opacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Plotly does this all while backing up your graphs on the cloud, so that years later, you can find data that may have otherwise been on a harddrive in a landfill. If you make your data public, other people can also find your graphs and  data. The best practice that we have today for saving and sharing research data is to entomb it as a thesis in the engineering library basement. All that is changing.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Like <a href=\"http://d3js.org/\" target=\"_blank\">d3.js</a>? Like interactive, <a href=\"https://plot.ly/~bchartoff/344/\" target=\"_blank\">NYT graphics</a>? So do we. Now, with the Plotly APIs, you can make them yourself without being an expert web programmer. If you are an expert web programmer, now you have scientific languages and tools like  R, Python, Pandas, and MATLAB instead of javascript to wrangle your data and create beautiful data vis. Science meets the world-wide-web. Engineering meets design. Let's do this."
